	  Recently, I have been obessed with cryptocurrency, my passion for solving problems in the space led me to learning React.js and becoming the developer I am today.

  		  <!-- <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>
          I love collaborative building, good food (especially hummus), socializing, hiking, biking, listening to music and traveling as much as I can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technically, I love iOS development and everything around it. You can find me watching WWDC videos in my free time or creating prototypes. Every day, I'm learning how to better build elegant, scalable and technologically-focused solutions.
