    		<h2>About Me</h2>

  		  <p>
          I am a passionate builder, avid reader, and infinite learner with a love for startups.
        </p>

        <p>

          Recently, I have been passionate about cryptocurrency, my passion for solving products in the space led me to learning React.js and becoming the developer I am today. Currently blockchain is equivalent to where the web was in 1992, with the hype of the web in 1998.
          Although there is tons of hype, I still believe in the tech, and thus have been playing around with smart contracts.
          Creating smart contracts has been a blast so far, and I'm planning on building something really
          cool, really soon! If you're interested in collaborating on a project let me know.
        </p>

  		  <!-- <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>
          I love collaborative building, good food (especially hummus), socializing, hiking, biking, listening to music and traveling as much as I can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technically, I love iOS development and everything around it. You can find me watching WWDC videos in my free time or creating prototypes. Every day, I'm learning how to better build elegant, scalable and technologically-focused solutions.
